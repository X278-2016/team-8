Things people will need who work on this project next semester:
1. Need to know if there will be both user AND admin access to the assessment. Do they want an admin to be able to make changes and alter the questions/goals?
2. The VHealth API - necessary for tracking their progress compared to other practices.
3. Access to the actual learning module components. Videos, worksheets, more quizzes? 
4. Need to know what the numerical score from the assessment translates to as far as the learning module and timeline. If someone gets a score of say 13, how do we know what to recommend for them exactly? 
5. Can the users alter their timeline for the learning module based on their practice's schedule?
